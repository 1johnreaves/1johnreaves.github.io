In learning how to use LaTeX and beamers, created a website intended to help 
people come up with outlines for beamers quickly, using regular expressions. As 
such, I call the project [QuikBeamer](https://quikbeamer.onrender.com/). 
It's quite basic, and was last updated in 2022, but I hope it's useful!
