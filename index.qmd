<br>

Welcome!

<br><br>

My name is John Reaves, and I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in the Department of
Economics at Michigan State University (MSU). 

My research interests lie within urban 
economics, public economics, and industrial organization, primarily focused on
how mobile Internet access changed the competitive landscape.
